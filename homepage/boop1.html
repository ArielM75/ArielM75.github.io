        <p>On the way home from just about anywhere, I pass by the “Metro strip” as we call it. This is a street that stands out among the seemingly infinite expanse of the city. There’s a very out-of-place “I Heart NY'' store that has somehow managed to stay open longer than most things on the block, restaurants and other ordinary storefronts decorating the block, but it’s what’s on the corner that matters. With METRO DINER in bold letters, outlined in eye-catching neon red neon lights, this is the center of attention. Everyone in the area frequents the Diner and it's a staple of the neighborhood. The menu is classic, delicious and is an overall delightful environment. Inside, one can center themselves, relax in the comfort of the servers, the sizzle of the grill and the ding of the order bell. Memories are made here. In fact, my family has been to this diner since I was little so it’s a go-to place for us.

With METRO DINER in bold letters, outlined in eye-catching neon red neon lights, this is the center of attention. Everyone in the area frequents the Diner and it's a staple of the neighborhood. The menu is classic, delicious and is an overall delightful environment. Inside, one can center themselves, relax in the comfort of the servers, the sizzle of the grill and the ding of the order bell. Memories are made here. In fact, my family has been to this diner since I was little so it’s a go-to place for us. Even when we don’t go to the diner I pass by this street almost everyday on the way home from wherever I’ve been. I’ve come to associate passing the Diner with being close to home, silently chanting “I’m almost there” on the days I’m far past exhausted. Being on the corner, the window booths have a pleasant view into the street. Broadway is busy, but not so much that it's uncomfortably chaotic like Rush Hour downtown. The Flourescent lights of the Diner always illuminate the street in a gravitating glow. Through the window one can see the passerby, the sidewalk, the crosswalk, and oh just far enough away to seem distant, is the old Metro Theater. The old Metro Theater was once the staple of the street. My mom says that she went all the time to the theater, explaining that it was grand and extraordinary beyond the reclining chairs of AMC. She talks about the interior’s murals and how it was a spectacular place. The old Metro Theater has been closed since I was born and before then. The boards deteriorated, It’s in shambles, the once brilliant lights of the marquee are all but burned out and broken. The empty ad frames hang shattered along the wall. All that’s left of this icon is its husk. Sitting in Metro Diner I often would stare into the cold Drama faces of the Theater as we rambled on about the day's events. Once, while my mom spread rumors that the theater would be renovated and finally reopened I couldn’t help but feel their empty sockets bore into me, as if it knew we gossipped of its dilapidated state.
          The theater and the diner are opposites, with the latter being a warm, welcoming staple of the community while the former is but a shell which lingers on the street empty and forgotten. While the Theater is a place of the past, the diner is the present. False. The two are one and the same- while their physical states are separate they are one continuation of the Metro strip. The Diner is not immortal just the Theater is not, but they are part of something that is. There is no time to mourn the closing of the past when the present continues on because their real impact is everlasting and reincarnated in the next building. The Metro’s purpose is to be an abode for us to cherish and celebrate in. Once they no longer are something else is, and the Metro legacy continues on passed onto something else, or someone else. </p>
